        My name is Allen Shamrock, and I am from Kenya. I joined the School of
        Engineering program to sharpen my skills in cloud infrastructure
        architecture and gain hands-on experience in designing scalable, secure
        systems. As a passionate technology enthusiast, I thrive in innovative
        tech spaces and am committed to mastering cutting-edge cloud solutions.
        My goal is to become a certified cloud architect, contribute to Africa’s
        growing tech ecosystem, and leverage this program’s knowledge to solve
        real-world infrastructure challenges.
